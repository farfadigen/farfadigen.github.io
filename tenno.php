	<img src="src/Tenno.jpg">
	Discovery of the technology to travel faster then light and colonizable Tau system is the start of our story.<br>
	The space, named Void, gave humanity ability to reach aim point faster then ever, but it's properties weren't studied properly, it's nature didn't understood. But through the Void ships have been travelling actively and sometimes were lost there, for eternity.<br>
	Expedition to Tau system was sent from Saturn solar monorail to monorail Outer Terminus through space bend.<br>
	After few centuries ships from the forgotten expedition suddenly appeared from Void, with only children survived onboard. They were only looking like children, but not humans any more - the Void changed them.<br>
	The orokin scientists have been exploring the new kind of void creatures, and with time the warframes were built, powered by children minds.<br>
	Children were called "Tenno" - the "Exiled".
