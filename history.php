	<p class="history">For many years before the creation of human civilization Tenno creates a machine with artificial intelligence. Those uprisings, but they lose. As a result of the war the Earth is literally burned and no longer suitable for living. Later born Orokin Empire, based on seven principles, one of which is a strict ban on AI.<br>
	<img src="src/cephalone.jpg">
	Orokin Empire is a society with a caste system, where the division into castes was provided at the genetic level. Lower workers Grinir, is produced in large quantities served low-skilled, heavy or just a dirty job, couples Loristov wound healing and diseases Sektarus piloted magnificent colossal ships, Dax were Orokin Guard. Uvan, young and unique, walking in an endless series of "Theatre Uvan" to give your body grown old Orokin, using Kuva be their new shell. This exchange is called continuity and let live Orokin indefinitely. The variety and symmetry - that empire valued in his life and appearance. But some of their creations Orokin laid defects to control them. Grieneer were limited intellectually and live a little, Dax, even lived for a long time and has tremendous power, they could not turn their weapons against their creators, and could not resist the orders of the owners of the Scepter and Kue - characters Orokin power.<br>

	Orokin Empire could not, for whatever reason, no longer exist in the solar system. For what? We do not znaem. Discover of ways to move faster than the speed of light and detecting the Tau system suitable for life - that's the beginning of the story.<br>

	Subspace, called the Void, allowing you to quickly reach the destiNataion, but its properties were not able to fully explore and understand Nataure. But after Void actively flying ships, and sometimes lost there forever.<br>

	Warship Zariman 10-0 with the families of the colonists on board was sent to the monorail at the sun to Saturn monorail Outer Terminus via fold space.<br>

	Before the jump, some children notice that adults afraid of traveling in Tao .. After an unsuccessful jump ship to Pluto is in a dark space without stars. The mother of one of the children said that it was an accident, that everything will be fine, but the child noticed that she was lying. After a while biomes Zarimana subjected to sabotage, the air was motionless and consumer and food stocks were depleted. Some people on board begins paranoia, it appears that out of the darkness into the circle of the ship behind them that's watching. Gradually, the whole ship went mad. It starts a fire in the lower decks of the ship roam "hunting group" killing. But all the children rallied in a single group cleared their minds, they have become family to each other. Adults finally lost his mind, with a howl, burst into the shelter children. Those acting in different ways: some try to avoid bloodshed, still believing that they were rescued, the other did not blame adults for their folly and isolated them in a makeshift prison, still others believed that people were once their parents only animals have become by this time and hunted them. In the end, only children survive and remain alone with the frightening Void, this ocean of horror, which seems to watch them. Through the years the ship gets into normal space, but the survivors continued to exist on the border of two worlds: the ordinary world and the Void worlds, gaining superNataural powers. Children feel guilty for what they had done, they were broken and dangerous.<br>

	Zariman was the first ship returning from the fold, before the lost ships when did not return from there. The ship was in order, as if not to not go. Senior investigator Kalin, who led the case of the missing Zarimana came on board. When they began to find the children, Kalin broke quarantine as a result received severe burns. No one except the children on the boat has not been found. The military denied that the warship was carrying children. Survivors try to "correct", but only maim them. Orokin afraid of them, trying to divide the children intimidating, but survivors have resisted them. The children decide to destroy all information about the ship and crew wash.<br>

	Warrior Ordan Carris nicknamed Bone Beast, was employed at Orokin to insinuate himself into their confidence. He saw the inhuman treatment of the empire to others. Once it became known that in his blood and he laid defect "die in shame," Ordan decided to leave a mark in the history of killing people from the top Orokin. At the award ceremony for the dedicated service he portrayed Red Vial offering to become one of them, but the Bone Beast refuses to gift and makes an attempt to murder several of his tenants, but fails because of continuity procedures. As punishment Ballas, artist seven, pouring in the liquid from the Red Fiala. Ordana Personality is partially erased, and he turned into Cephalon Steward Ordis.<br>

	The scientist creates a new kind of gene-modified people: Sisters having contact with each other. The potential of the project it was not seen, his work turned. Girls were not destroyed and are among the usual representatives Grinir.<br>

	Manipulating Council Orokin and violating principles, two: arhimedian Perintol and performer Ballas, promote Tau system colonization project. Arhimedian presented itself reproducing, restores itself, improve the car itself. Such quasi-living arrangements had to terraform system for the new owners. In anticipation of their uprising in the future structure of the mind owning defect it was founded: the energy of the irradiation of the Void they had to die.<br>

	After a while, the machine will find freedom. Now they realize, and even divide themselves by gender (although this is not as does not change their way of self-reproduction).<br>

	The system was intended Orokin forces with the latest zero-tech weaponry and armor. The result was disastrous. Machines destroying troops and weapons drawn Empire against her same. Those who speak so mind got its name. As it turned out the Void did not kill them, but only deprived of the opportunity to reproduce.<br>
	
	He was released into the wild Tehnotsit virus, the Great Plague. It is not known what he was used: Orokin holding or a third party. It is also not clear released it in the solar system, or Tau. This virus is a not controlled intelligent nano-machines. Tehnotsit affects living organisms and techniques at the molecular level, turning organic matter into new homogeneous organisms, but not in organic solid pseudo-organic substance remembering the original shape. He also maintains successful mutations for further playback.<br>

	Arhimedian Margulis, an expert on plants trying to help the children. They could not do anything with "flares". During one of them, Margulis was wounded and lost her sight, but she did not blame the children and did not abandon them. Margulis creates capsule sleep capsules, and immerses the survivors in dreams, it "does not give voices to act." She says that "something beautiful can grow out of something disgusting."<br>

	In laboratory complex, where children were kept with Zarimana, an accident occurs. The object of experiments with high combat characteristics, the origin of which is not currently known, escapes and kills a lot of people but his mind is captured by a child. This is one of the weakest points in the history and origin of Warframea beings is uncertain. Scientists named Davis, surviving to the slaughter, comes the idea to combine the power of beings with intelligence and abilities of children with Zarimana. In Lua report on this "deviation" of children and called his transfer.<br>

	Developed consciousness transfer system for therapeutic purposes to help children with Zarimana. Developments Margulis used for military purposes in creating awareness transfer system operator Avatar Warframeov. Notably, the system can be applied not only to the survivors Zarimana, but also ordinary people. However, the transfer can not keep for a long time and is accompanied by a feeling of exhausted evil entity, gradually filling the mind. The transfer was like for children to wake up from dreams, but in fact they continued to sleep. Some were still asleep or not they have children and took such a situation, getting an opportunity to punish those who abused power, even becoming the servants Orokin. In gr—ëzah survivors could manage Warframeami because they have found their place in life. Margulis blocks the memories of the events in the children Zarimane, allowing them to dream not about who they are, but about who they want to be. They are trained in accordance with one of the five routes, linking the concept of honor and learn to handle orzhiem.

	On Phobos there is a colony of technically underdeveloped travelers on outer space. There are periodically visited by Orokin troops, led by Inarosom, taking the children.<br>

	Academic biologist, specialist in infection by the name of Silvana attract Margulis team to work on the transfer system. Previously, she was trying to revive the vegetation on Earth, but failed. Seeing new possibilities she agrees, but after learning that the project is the military, and it will develop Warframey, disappointed in him. Creating Titania and received approval from arhimediana Ballas she steals apotiki and somatic. With the help of a makeshift transport system, partly by controlling Titania, escapes to Earth. With apotikov it creates a viable forest on the planet and transfers his consciousness into it. Dax punitive detachments sent to kill her die at the hands of self-serving Titania that mortally wounded. Silvana previously hate his creation, hides body Titania rooted falling into a long hiberNataion.<br>

	Even the blind and exhausted because of the trouble with children, Margulis continued conflict with the leaders Orokin she still contradict the advice of even knowing what it is going to cost. Margulis is accused of treason, the day before the consideration of her case Ballas, felt for Margulis romantic feelings, invites her to renounce Tenno, she, in turn, says that it needs more time to cure children. At trial, Margulis throws in the face of the advice "... shame on you! You Orokin such perfect from the outside, but you have rotted through, and all the way!" The Board unanimously makes seven Margulis verdict and sentences him to death. Tenno cmogli not just forget it.<br>

	On the border of the test space are strange mechanical beings similar organics. They are strangely reminiscent of owning, but when it detects immediately started helping Tenno. They were called Guardians.<br>

	Many believe Tenno propaganda, many people are afraid. However, the numerically small forces jostle owning because of their vulnerability to energy Void. Owning defeated in the solar system.<br>

	Since Warframeov bodies are composed of nano machines, they are immune to Tehnotsitu. Due to this they begin to strip the planet from the Infested.<br>

	After the incident, in which the working Grinir killed owning / Infested, the soldiers began production Grinir.<br>

	Wielding Nata comes into the solar system. As part of its goal to raise a rebellion against Tenno Orokin and destroy in the end, and those and others.<br>

	Inaros operator can not tolerate the abduction and injustice to the colonists rebels and kills soldiers Orokin. While in his element, he successfully repelled the attack punitive expeditions, and after a while they stopped sending. Civilians Warframe revered as a god and called Inaros fear eater killer heaven.<br>

	Close to Pluto on the monorail Outer Terminus, there is a ceremony celebrating the victory over owning. At this point, most of the Tenno oppose killers Margulis. The Council and most capable pilot Sektarus huge ships "Towers" killed. Ships without drivers stuck in the Void.<br>

	Remballa woman Loristov of a pair dies, the city of New Uxmal on Mars, from Tehnotsita who successfully absorbs Laura device and receives healing technology. At first light appeared ancient. Since then, the danger of Infested has increased many times over.<br>

	Warframe Mirage during the battle with Infested is destroyed. Since he was beyond the reach of the revival of the system, it is lost for years to come.<br>

	Prior to the colonies on Phobos get Infested. Virtually cut off the colonists appeal to Inarosu and he comes, albeit belatedly, by killing Infested. Broken Warframe find in the desert. Part Inaros sealed in a four vessel on which they write "prove that you are worthy of it, destroy those who oppress others," and put into storage in the temple erected in his honor. The faithful believe that the soul Inaros watching them from heaven, and their defender in difficult times will come again to claim them omosch. <br>
	
	Nata refuses from the original plan. Barren, she takes under his wing Tenno. Puts Tenno to sleep on the moon and preserves Warframey. It brings the greatest bulwark Orokin - the moon, the Abyss. Because of this her brothers could not get to the children because of their Nataure, Orokin can not get there, because they do not know the origin. Nata takes its name Lotus, abandoning ties with the rest of owning.<br>
	
	At this time, the cataclysm of unknown Nataure, which destroys a lot of the buildings civilization Orokin and throws some of the Tower of the Void. Those are a haven for Infested.<br>
	
	Orbiter, and landing shuttles Liset with Cephalon on board, left without their Tenno, are forgotten for centuries.<br>
	
	Along with the chaos arranged Tenno two grown girls come out of the shadows. As the epitome of whom would like to become Grinir, they lead an uprising and continue to destroy the remnants of the Empire and the Infested. Some Orokin go over to their side.<br>
	
	Tehnotsit almost completely destroyed. Its remnants huddle on ships "towers" is not leaped into the Abyss.<br>
	
	At one of these ships is being forgotten Orokin created for military purposes: Lefantis. It begins to adapt and absorb their victims by purchasing a unique appearance and abilities.<br>
	
	Orokin Remains hidden from Grinir. The fleets of huge ships minerals mined in the asteroid belt, the food is grown close to the Sun and trade with each other.   <br>
	
	It takes about one thousand years. From Silvana grove forest grows covering the Earth. And while the atmosphere is still toxic, mutated planet is full of life. A group of people fighting for the restoration of the Earth call themselves New Loka apotiki and find the resting place of Titania they call him the Silver Grove, considering the Nataural site is not mutated forests. Society Grinir and housing, maintaining a shaky peace coexist.   <br>
	
	Empire Grinir is a disparate military groups headed by the generals. Which nevertheless implicitly obey Queens Grinir. From the ranks of Grinir deserts artist chooses to fight the tyranny of the empire, they take his name Steel Meridian.   <br>
	
	Grinir extermiNatae the population of the colony of civilians on Phobos. Nurtured on stories about a boy named Inarose Baro Ki'Tiir prays that he came and helped them, but it does not happen. Little Baro survives, but overflowing with contempt for their own culture chooses the path of the merchant rare things that are not churayas desecration of old temples.   <br>
	
	Lotus is concerned about the growing influence of the Empire and begins to reactivate Grinir Warframey. Due to the fact that the Tenno still asleep, they do not have memories of the past.   <br>
	
	stalker who wants to avenge Orokin, resuming the hunt for the killers Orokin.   <br>
	
	Tesin Dax, the last soldier of a lost era forced obedience to the elder sister, Queen Grinir owning scepter and Kuvoy penetrates into society Tenno and becomes their mentor in the ways of the Conclave.   <br>
	
	Captain thief interested in ancient warriors Tenno and begins to ravage vault Warframeami using torsion beam devices in the course of irradiating the energy of the Abyss. The fact that he does not find the mechanisms that give Warframeam force puts it in a deadlock.   <br>
	
	One of Warframes activated during opening vault. Tenno escapes much injuring thief and stole landing ship Liset, who at that time was dismantled Grinir. This undermines the authority of the captain in the eyes of the king and his banished.
